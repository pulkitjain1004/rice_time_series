# rice_time_series

These scripts do a multivariate time-series analysis on Rice prices. The project uses conversion to stationary, ARIMA models, multivariate analysis and ARCG-GARCH fitting for non-constant variance. I was one of the four members responsible for the academic project.

Relevant polts along with the code have been uploaded. Please contact the author for their interpretation.

Agriculture commodities are highly linked with food security, particularly in developing and underdeveloped countries. Prior to 2006, rice prices rose slowly with small variation. Then between 2006 and 2008 the rice market became increasingly volatile sending panic through rice-dependent countries. By 2008 the price was more than double the pre-2006 value. Price fluctuations put significant pressure on government welfare programs and by analyzing and understanding the price determinants of rice long term planning can become more effective.
